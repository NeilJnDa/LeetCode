*Hard*

## Description

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.

```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Note:**

- `s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
- `p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `.` or `*`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

## Solution: Dynamic Programming

Anyway, brute force is not the solution I want to try. Just get into a better algorithm. 

When matching characters, I want to know whether the proceeding characters match. We can define `dp[i][j]` to cache the intermediate results. If `dp[i][j]` is `true`, it means the substring $s_0...s_i$ matches $p_0...p_j$

Further, we can add a space ` ' '`  both at the start of `s` and `p` to uniform the situations when strings are empty.

```c++
        s = " " + s;
        p = " " + p;
```

### Initial State

Empty `s` can match empty `p`, `dp[0][0] = true;`

### Transfer Equations

- The simplest case is  `s[i] == p[j]`. It only needs to check the strings without `s[i]` and `p[j]`, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.

- If `p[j]` is `.`, it can match any single character in `s`. `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.

- When `p[j]` is `*`, anyway, it goes rather complex. We need to check `p[j-1]`:

  - If `p[j-1] != s[i]`, this `*a` will match nothing in `s`. In this case, `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]`. (Remove the ending two characters `*a`)

  - If `p[j-1] == s[i]` or `p[j-1] == '.'`, at least it will match one character in `s`. But we should carefully think about other possible situations. However, `*a` might match nothing or one character or more characters. Specially, `.*` could match a string like `"abc"` while `a*` could not match `"abc"`. `dp[i][j]` is determined by the below three situations whose relationship is `OR`.

    1. `a*` or `.*` matches nothing is `s`, `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]`

    2. `a*` or `.*` matches single character, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-2]`; (Not necessary)

    3. `a*` or `.*  `matches multi characters, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`. In this situation, it hands over the problem of what else can this `a*` match to the former record `dp[i-1][j]`.

>**Optimization**:

>Do we really need the situation 2. when `a*` or `.*` matches single character?

>In fact, it can be included in the situation 3. It utilize the result of `dp[i-1][j]`. If the situation matching single character happens, in the previous `dp[i-1][j]` judgment process, it would result in matching nothing.
