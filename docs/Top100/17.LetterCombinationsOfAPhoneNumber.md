## Description

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example:**

```
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
```

**Note:**

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

## Solution 1: DFS

It is a typical question of Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. 

- We need a table to record mapping relationship (A hash table also works).
- Follow the direction of `i` increasing to reach one result firstly.
- No boundary conditions.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> mapping = {"abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"};
    vector<string> letterCombinations(string digits) {
        vector<string> res;
        if(digits.empty())return res;
        dfs(res, digits, "", 0);
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(vector<string>  & res, string & digits, string str, int i){
        if(i >= digits.size()) res.push_back(str);
        else{
            string choices = mapping[digits[i] - '2'];
            for(int j = 0; j < choices.size(); j++){
                str.push_back(choices[j]);
                dfs(res, digits, str, i+1);
                str.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Key Point

The key point of DFS is **entering the recursive process in every layer's loop.** Focus on these lines of code.

```c++
 for(int j = 0; j < choices.size(); j++){
                str.push_back(choices[j]);
                dfs(res, digits, str, i+1);
                str.pop_back();
 }
```

It adds one of the character choices to the end of `str`, then immediately enters the `dfs` recursive function to find what the next digit represents. After the end of the recursion, it deletes the back character since **there are other choices worth trying** in the next round of `for` loop.

## Solution 2: BFS

Breadth First Search is easy to understand, but requires **an extra queue**.

- Push what the first digit represents into the queue.
- For every following digit, search all the possible combinations:
  - Get the front string element `t` of the queue.
    - Add one possible letter to the end of the string `t`  and push it into the queue.
    - Add another possible letter to `t`  then push into the queue.
    - And so on...
  - Pop this front element.
- Transfer the queue into a table and return it.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> mapping = {"abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"};
    vector<string> letterCombinations(string digits) {
        vector<string> res;
        queue<string> q;
        if(digits.empty())return res;
        string choices = mapping[digits[0] - '2'];
        string t;
        for(int k = 0; k < choices.size(); k++){
            t.push_back(choices[k]);
            q.push(t);
            t.pop_back();
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < digits.size(); i++){
            string choices = mapping[digits[i] - '2'];
            int qLen = q.size();
            for(int j = 0; j < qLen; j++){
                string t = q.front();
                for(int k = 0; k < choices.size(); k++){
                    t.push_back(choices[k]);
                    q.push(t);
                    t.pop_back();
                }
                q.pop();
            }
        }
        while(!q.empty()){
            res.push_back(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Key Point

Anyway, it doesn't seem grace and costs more memory usage. But it is a possible solution.

**The key point of BFS is an extra queue to record intermediate results.**



## Complexity Analysis

In this question, BFS and DFS both have exponential complexity.

Time complexity: $O(3^m \times 4 ^n)$

Space complexity: $O(3^m \times 4 ^n)$

$m$ is the total amount of $2,3,4,5,6$ which represent three letter, and $n$ is the total amount of $7,8,9$.

>In a graph question with $n$ nodes, BFS and DFS both have $O(n)$ space complexity since they only need to traverse one node for only one time.
