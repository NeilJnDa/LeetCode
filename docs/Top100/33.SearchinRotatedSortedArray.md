## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Solution: Binary Search

The method of binary searching is not hard to come up with, but the difficult point is to deal with the rotation.

After rotation, there still exists an ordered part either on the left of `mid` or right of `mid`. We need to discuss by situations.

- If `nums[left] < nums[mid]`, the pattern is like `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`. The left side of `mid` is ordered.
  - If `nums[left] < target <= nums[mid]`, the target might be in the left part. `right = mid - 1`;
  - Otherwise, it might be in the right part. `left = mid + 1`.

- If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, the pattern is like `[4,5,6,0,1,2,3]`. The right side of `mid` is ordered.
  - If`nums[mid] <= target < nums[right]`, the target might be in the right part. `left = mid + 1`;
  - Otherwise, it might be in the left part. `right = mid - 1`.

### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if(nums.empty())return -1;
        int left = 0, right = nums.size()-1;
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        while(left <= right){
            if(target == nums[mid])return mid;
            if(nums[left] <= nums[mid]){
                if(target < nums[mid] && target >= nums[left]) right = mid - 1;
                else left = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) left = mid + 1;
                else right = mid - 1;
            }
            mid = (left + right) / 2;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
