## Description

*Medium*

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Think about it first

It seems to be a simple elementary math problem. There are some key points 

that are worth considering carefully.

- **Carry**: For example, $5+7=12$. The next digit should will be added by the carry. We need an extra variable `carry` to record it (must be either $0$ or $1$). In addition, if `carry == 1` after the iteration, we should link a new node with $1$ as `val` to the end of result List Node.
- **Empty head node**: In order to ignore special cases, we can set an empty head node for the result.
- **Two pointers**: `l1` and `l2` will be set to theirs next nodes before next iteration. The add function should continue as long as one of them is not  `nullptr`.
- When one of `l1` or `l2` is `nullptr`, how to add: `···+(l1?l1->val:0)`

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode* last = new ListNode();
        ListNode* head = last;
        while(l1||l2){
            ListNode* cur = new ListNode();
            cur->val = (l1?l1->val:0) + (l2?l2->val:0) + carry;
            carry = cur->val / 10;
            cur->val %= 10;
            if(l1)l1=l1->next;
            if(l2)l2=l2->next;
            last->next = cur;
            last = last->next;
        }
        if(carry) last->next = new ListNode(1, nullptr);
        return head->next;
    }
};
```

Just record the previous digit `ListNode* pre `, if a carry occurs in the current digit, then do`pre->val++`.
