## Description

Given n non-negative integers $a1, a2, ..., an$ , where each represents a point at coordinate $(i, ai)$. $n$ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at $(i, ai)$ and $(i, 0)$. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.



The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

## Solution 1: Brute Force

Just to verify we understand the question. It is rather time-consuming.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxValue = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < height.size() - 1; i++){
            for(int j = i + 1; j < height.size(); j++){
                int area = (j - i) * std::min(height[i], height[j]);
                if(area > maxValue) maxValue = area;
            }
        }
        return maxValue;
    }
};
```



## Solution 2: Two Pointers

Set two pointers `i`, `j`, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. At every step, we try to shrink the range of the container. The key point is to determine which side we should change.

The intuition is that the area is determined by the shorter line. 

$area = (j-i) \times min(height[i], height[j])$ 

If we shrink the long side, $j-i$ will decrease, and $min(height[i], height[j])$ is only possible to reduce. We can not find a larger area.

If we shrink the short side, though $j-i$ will decrease, $min(height[i], height[j])$ would increase if there exists longer line next to the previous short side. And $area$ would probably increase.

By this method, we exclude the cases that can not be a larger container and continuously find the most possible result.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxValue = 0;
        int i = 0, j = height.size()-1;
        while(i < j){
            int area = (j - i) * std::min(height[i], height[j]);
            if(maxValue < area) maxValue = area;
            if(height[i] < height[j]) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        return maxValue;
    }
};
```

Time complexity: $O(n)$

Space complexity: $O(1)$
